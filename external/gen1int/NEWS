!! list of user-visible changes worth mentioning, keep old items after the newer ones
!! or move some older items into ONEWS when NEWS gets long refer the user to ONEWS at the end

Version 0.2.1 (4 October 2010)
========================================================================
* NEW rewrite Gen1Int, and provide the Python interface
* CHANGE rewrite the recurrence relations explicitly instead of using recursive
         functions, to be more efficient
* NEW implement London atomic-orbital in Version 0.2.0
      implement rotational London atomic-orbital in Version 0.2.1
      both of them are evaluated at zero fields
* NEW implement CMake
* NEW implement interface using C language

Version 0.1.0 (26 September 2009)
========================================================================
* NEW release under GNU Lesser General Public License
* CHANGE use type structure for the generalized one-electron operator
* CHANGE move the geometric derivatives out of the definition of operator,
         so it becomes easier and more efficient to compute geometric
         derivatives of any property integrals to any order
* CHANGE give up previous auxiliary function for operator 1/r_C^2 (because,
         we failed to find a stable upward recursion relations); the new
         auxiliary function for operator 1/r_C^2 is \int_0^1\exp(-T(1-u^2))u^{2n}du,
         which requires different recursion relations for calculating integrals
* CHANGE change the operators of property integral as one-dimensional array,
         which is more convenient to sum over operators
* FIX the bug for calculating derivatives -- we need to explicitly consider what the
      derivatives will act, the center of bra, ket, r function or multipole moments,
      using product rule in calculus and translation invariance
* NEW calculations of expectation values
* NEW allow the center of multipole moments always being the center of ket, for property
      integrals "ANGLON"
* NEW we use three level structures:
      (1) type "g1prop" defines, like the geometric derivatives acting on a property,
      (2) type "g1int1" defines the integrals belong to this property,
      (3) type "g1opt" defines the generalized one-electron operators
          belong to each property integral ("g1int1")
* CHANGE add module "gen1int_derv" which takes care the derivatives
* NEW magnetic derivatives of London atomic-orbital
* FIX AO density matrix of open-shell system
* FIX bug of transformation between Cartesian and Hermite Gaussians

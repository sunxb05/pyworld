The Polarizable Embedding library
=================================

The Polarizable Embedding library (PElib) provides embedding functionality
to quantum chemical programs.

Currently the library features:

    * Three embedding models (all of which can be included in a single calculation)
        - polarizable density embedding (PDE)
        - polarizable embedding (PE)
        - continuum solvation (FixSol)
